# Results and Performance
The  metric  we  used  to  evaluate  our  model  is  TMCCOEFF NORMED. It basically calculates the overlap-ping  area  by  sliding  through  a  window.  Basically  weare using normalized TM CCOEFF for getting unbiasedresults. Below are results: Time taken by our algorithm is3.5776607990264893 seconds. Total number of protraits9.Our  Average  TM  CCOEFF  NORMED  coefficientis 0.97. Our algorithm can be used in number plate andfinger print matching.
